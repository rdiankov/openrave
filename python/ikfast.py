IKFast: The Robot Kinematics Compiler
-------------------------------------

.. image:: ../../images/ikfast_robots.jpg
  :width: 640

IKFast analytically solves robot inverse kinematics equations and generates optimized C++ files.

The inverse kinematics equations arise from attemping to place the robot end effector coordinate
system in the world while maintaining joint and user-specified constraints. User-specified constraints make up many different `IK Types`_, each of them having advantages depending on the task.

IKFast will work with any number of joints arranged in a chain; this is defined by the `Robot.Manipulator`. For chains containing more degrees of freedom (DOF) than the IK type requires, the user can set arbitrary values of a subset of the joints until the number of unknown joints matches the degrees of freedom of the IK type.

It is not trivial to create hand-optimized inverse kinematics solutions for arms that can capture all degenerate cases, having closed-form IK speeds up many tasks including planning algorithms, so it really is a must for most robotics researchers.

Closed-form solutions are necessary for motion planning due to two reasons:

- Numerical inverse kinematics solvers will always be much slower than closed form solutions. Planners require being able to process thousands of configurations per second. The closed-form code generated by ikfast can produce solutions on the order of **~4 microseconds**! As a comparison, most numerical solutions are on the order of 10 milliseconds (assuming good convergence).
- The null space of the solution set can be explored because all solutions are computed.

Features
========

- Can handle robots with arbitrary joint complexity like non-intersecting axes.
- All possible discrete solutions calculated (can be up to 16).
- Generated C++ code **independent** of OpenRAVE or any other library.
- Automatically detects degenerate cases where 2 or more axes align and cause infinite solutions.
- Invalid solutions are detected by checking if square roots are given negative values or arc sines and arc cosines are given inputs exceeding the [-1,1] range.
- All divide by zero conditions are automatically checked and handled.

.. _ikfast_types:

IK Types
--------

The following inverse kinematics types are supported:

* **Transform6D** - end effector reaches desired 6D transformation
* **Rotation3D** - end effector reaches desired 3D rotation
* **Translation3D** - end effector origin reaches desired 3D translation
* **Direction3D** - direction on end effector coordinate system reaches desired direction
* **Ray4D** - ray on end effector coordinate system reaches desired global ray
* **Lookat3D** - direction on end effector coordinate system points to desired 3D position
* **TranslationDirection5D** - end effector origin and direction reaches desired 3D translation and direction. Can be thought of as Ray IK where the origin of the ray must coincide.
* **TranslationXY2D** - end effector origin reaches desired XY translation position, Z is ignored. The coordinate system with relative to the base link.
* **TranslationLocalGlobal6D** - local point on end effector origin reaches desired 3D global point. Because both local point and global point can be specified, there are 6 values.

The possible solve methods are defined by `ikfast.IKFastSolver.GetSolvers()`

Usage
-----

The main file ikfast.py can be used both as a library and as an executable program. For advanced users, it is also possible to use run ikfast.py as a stand-alone program, which makes it mostly independent of the OpenRAVE run-time. 

**However, the recommended way of using IKFast** is through the OpenRAVE :ref:`databases.inversekinematics` database generator which directly loads the IK into OpenRAVE as an interface. 

Stand-alone Executable
======================

To get help and a description of the ikfast arguments type

.. code-block:: bash

  python `openrave-config --python-dir`/openravepy/_openravepy_/ikfast.py --help

A simple example to generate IK for setting the 3rd joint free of the Barrett WAM is

.. code-block:: bash

  python `openrave-config --python-dir`/openravepy/_openravepy_/ikfast.py --robot=robots/barrettwam.robot.xml --baselink=0 --eelink=7 --savefile=ik.cpp --freeindex=2

Through Python
==============

IKFast can also be used as a library in python. Generating 6D IK for the Barrett WAM while setting the 3rd joint free can be achieved with:

.. code-block:: python

  kinbody = env.ReadRobotXMLFile('robots/barrettwam.robot.xml')
  env.AddRobot(kinbody)
  solver = ikfast.IKFastSolver(kinbody=kinbody)
  chaintree = solver.generateIkSolver(baselink=0,eelink=7,freeindices=[2],solvefn=ikfast.IKFastSolver.solveFullIK_6D)
  code = solver.writeIkSolver(chaintree)
  open('ik.cpp','w').write(code)

.. _ikfast_generatedcpp:

Using Generated IK Files
========================

The common usage is to generate a C++ file that can be compiled into a stand-alone shared object/DLL, an executable program, or linked in statically to a bigger project. For more complex kinematics, LAPACK_ is needed.

The C++ file uses the following defines:

- IKFAST_CLIBRARY - Define this linking statically or dynamically to get correct visibility.
- IKFAST_NO_MAIN - Remove the ``main`` function, usually used with IKFAST_CLIBRARY
- IKFAST_ASSERT - Define in order to get a custom assert called when NaNs, divides by zero, and other invalid conditions are detected.
- IKFAST_REAL - Use to force a custom real number type for IKReal.
- IKFAST_NAMESPACE - Enclose all functions and classes in this namespace, the ``main`` function is excluded.
- IKFAST_HEADER - specify a header file to include at the top. This would in the form of ``"header.h"``. In a compiler command line, it would look like: ``-DIKFAST_HEADER="\\\"header.h\\\""``

The global functions are:

.. code-block:: c++

  // Computes all IK solutions given a end effector coordinates and the free joints.
  bool ik(const IKReal* eetrans, const IKReal* eerot, const IKReal* pfree, std::vector<IKSolution>& vsolutions);
  
  // Computes the end effector coordinates givennn the joint values. This function is used to double check ik.
  void fk(const IKReal* joints, IKReal* eetrans, IKReal* eerot);
  
  // returns the number of free parameters users has to set apriori
  int getNumFreeParameters();
  
  // the indices of the free parameters indexed by the chain joints
  int* getFreeParameters();

  // the total number of indices of the chain
  int getNumJoints();

  // the size in bytes of the configured number type
  int getIKRealSize();

  // the ik type ID
  int getIKType();

  // a hash of all the chain values used for double checking that the correct IK is used.
  const char* getKinematicsHash();

Parameters:
  
- ``eetrans`` - 3 translation values. For iktype **TranslationXYOrientation3D**, the z-axis is the orientation.
- ``eerot`` - 9 values for the rotation matrix. For iktypes **Direction3D**, **Ray4D**, and **TranslationDirection5D**, the first 3 values represent the target direction.
- ``IKSolution`` - The discrete solutions are returned in this structure. Sometimes the joint axes of the robot can align allowing an infinite number of solutions. The ``IKSolution`` structure stores all these solutions in the form of free variables that the user has to set when querying the solution. Its prototype is:

.. code-block:: c++

  class IKSolution
  {
  public:
      void GetSolution(IKReal* psolution, const IKReal* pfree) const;
      const std::vector<int>& GetFree() const;
  };


Compiling with GCC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic command is:

.. code-block:: bash

  gcc -lstdc++ -o ik ik.cpp

This will generate a small program that outputs all solutions given the end effector with respect to the robot base.

Using gcc, this requires "-llapack" to be added, for MSVC++  

Compiling with MSVC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`LAPACK For Windows`_ should be installed in order to get complex kinematics linking correctly.

Details
-------

Terminology:

- **solve joints** - the joints to solve for using inverse kinematics

- **free joints** - the joints that are specified before the IK is run, these values are known at runtime, but not known at IK generation time.


The top level class is `ikfast.IKFastSolver` and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using definitions from `ikfast.AST`. The AST is then passed to the language-specific generators defined in `ikfast.CodeGenerators`.

Internal symbolic math uses sympy_. Infinite precision fractions are used in order to keep track of linearly independent equations and when they evaluate to 0. The infinite precision fractions are converted to decimals in the generators.

.. _LAPACK: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

.. _`LAPACK For Windows`: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/

.. _sympy: http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

Open Issues
-----------

1. currently ikfast does not handle big decimal numbers well. for example defining the axes or anchors as 1.032513241 will produce very big fractions and make things slow.

2. there are cases when axes align and there are infinite solutions. although ikfast can detect such cases, we need a lot more work in this area.

3. for 6D ik, there are still mechanisms it cannot solve, please send the kinematics model if such a situation is encountered.

4. there are 10 different types of IK, currently ray4d IK needs a lot of work.

FAQ
---

Q. **ikfast has been running for more than an hour, will it ever finish?**

A. Most likely not, usually an iksolver finishes within 10 minutes.
