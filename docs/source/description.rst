OpenRAVE provides an environment for testing, developing, and deploying motion planning algorithms in real-world robotics applications. The main focus is on simulation and analysis of kinematic and geometric information related to motion planning. OpenRAVE's stand-alone nature allows is to be easily integrated into existing robotics systems.

It provides many command line tools to work with robots and planners, and the run-time core is small enough to be used inside controllers and bigger frameworks. An important target application is industrial robotics automation.
